# Zendesk Tab Timer

This project includes two tools to help support agents stay on top of multiple Zendesk chats:

- **Chrome Extension**: Flashes inactive Zendesk ticket tabs and browser tab, with optional system notifications
- **Tampermonkey Script**: A simpler, script-only version for quick installation via Tampermonkey

## ðŸ”§ Use Case

When handling multiple Zendesk tickets at once, it's easy to lose track of which ones have been left waiting. This tool helps prevent that by flashing inactive tabs after 3 minutes of inactivity.
